       Don’t be fooled by the name, Stam joined the business in its 2nd year of operation and is the creative force behind our work, we just never got around to changing the branding.

Our work has been awarded by Fearless Photographers, a global community of the world’s best wedding photographers and we have both collected features and awards from the prestigious blog Junebug Weddings, and appeared in print and online in numerous other publications, including The Huffington Post.
<br />

We have always been passport stamp collectors and love to travel and take photos. We knew that being wedding photographers would give us the creative stimulation we wanted and the opportunity to do something meaningful for the couples we serve.
<br />
Having seen a very close friend of ours so disappointed with their wedding images, we decided this was the path we needed to walk to help couples, like you, get the memories you deserve from your special day.
<br />
We went to a wedding photography workshop that really opened our eyes to the creative possibilities and we haven’t looked back since. We have over ten years experience working with couples from all corners of the planet, and are so grateful we made the decision to specialise in it full time.
<br />
Since those early days we have established ourselves as destination wedding photographers and later started an online mentoring program for photographers (The Photographers Collective) that helps aspiring photographers to master their craft and build a sustainable business doing what they love.
<br />
As time passed, we began getting asked regularly about destination weddings and have ended up spending lots of time in the European winter in Thailand photographing weddings there.
<br />
The rest of the year we are based in London and work with couples from across the UK.
<br />
We have worked with hundreds of couples and are highly experienced at creating stunning images to savour your special piece of family history, without it taking over your wedding day. It is a personal and unobtrusive service that we would want at our own wedding
<br />
If you would like to find out more about how we work please contact us at info@liamcollard.com to set up a chat, or download our free guide for couples planning their wedding day on the link below.

We look forward to helping you have the best day and lifelong memories to savour it by.
